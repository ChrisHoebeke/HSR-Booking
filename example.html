<p>ABSTRACT: To mount an effective world wide response, oil
spill clean-up equipment and experienced personnel need to
quickly reach the scene. The distance and often remoteness of the
incident from an International response centre (Tier 3) dictates
that to achieve this rapid response air transport will be required.
</p>
<p>Speed, flexibility and frequency of scheduled flights combined
with increased availability on the charter market have made air
transport a realistic option to most areas of the world. Chartered
aircraft are most likely to be side-loading cargo jets and as such
response equipment needs to be suited both in size and ease of
loading/offloading.
</p>
<p>To assist in the air transportation of response equipment, a
specialised aircraft pallet system has been developed. The system
comprises of four pallet modules per aircraft pallet station which
have been profiled to fit within the most commonly used cargo
jets. Pre-packing the pallet modules decreases loading times con-
siderably, they can also be declared as known cargo helping
move them through the air cargo security procedures.
</p>
<p>An assessment of type and quantity of equipment required will
be made before dispatch, these small packages present maximum
flexibility and allow “mix and match” of different pallet modules
to create the final load.
</p>
<p>The modules can be delivered to airports with low capacity
offloading equipment. This is enhanced by a specialist self build
rapid equipment delivery and deployment system.
</p>
<p>Discussion
</p>
<p>There are a number of challenges facing a company needing to
transport large amounts of oil spill response equipment to support
an International spill response operation.
</p>
<p>As International response centres evolve, a process of constant
improvement must be implemented following every incident or
exercise. One example of this, is that to comply with the British
Aviation Security Act, Oil Spill Response Limited have achieved
the status of “Listed Air-cargo Agent” which allows staff to de-
clare equipment as “known” cargo allowing direct loading onto
an aircraft without further searches or security holding being
necessary.
</p>
<p>Aircraft type and availability are an important consideration. A
solution to this is to have a permanently chartered aircraft, con-
stantly on standby which can be mobilised at very short notice.
The provision of an L-382 Hercules, which primarily provides the
ability to use aerial dispersant delivery equipment, can also be
used more conventionally as a cargo aircraft. Permanently char-
tered aircraft allow load plans to be devised, reducing loading
</p>
<p>times and allowing staff the opportunity to train in aircraft load-
ing.
</p>
<p>When other aircraft are required, the services of a broker will
be essential. Having a permanent contract with a dedicated bro-
kerage company allows information on the state of the charter
market to be constantly available and ensures the provision of an
expert in aviation logistics 24 hours a day.
</p>
<p>As these particular challenges are being met, spill response
centres are looking at other problems they have historically en-
countered during spills and exercises.
</p>
<p>Palletisation. Key issues that have been identified are the
packaging of equipment, in terms of shape, contents and the
limitations of destination airports.
</p>
<p>Historically, with the exception of large stand alone items such
as offshore booms, equipment has been shipped in small pack-
ages, either boxes or cages, with each package containing a num-
ber of similar items. Before loading onto an aircraft, small pack-
ages would be arranged ad-hoc onto aircraft pallet trays, this
“trial and error” approach, slowed down the loading process.
</p>
<p>It was necessary to have a number of packages to provide all
the component parts to perform a specific task or operation. Once
on-scene, before being dispatched to individual sites, the equip-
ment would need dividing up to create working packages at a
central point. A solution to this problem has been the develop-
ment of dedicated system of aircraft pallet modules. Such a sys-
tem must fulfil certain requirements.
</p>
<p>No guarantees can be given as to what aircraft may be avail-
able on the charter market on a particular day, so any system must
be designed to fit within the cargo area profile of all the most
frequently used aircraft namely, Boeing 707s, Boeing 727s, DC8s
and DC10s. All these aircraft use the standard 125" × 88" aircraft
pallet station, so any system must be compatible with the standard
aircraft pallet tray.
</p>
<p>The pallet modules are positioned four per pallet tray, two on
the bottom, two on the top (Figure 1). The top modules are
shaped to allow them to fit within the profile of the aircraft while
maximising the volume available. The bottom modules measure 2
m × 1.47 m × 1.02 m giving a volume of 3 m3, whilst a top mod-
ule measures 2 m × 1.47 m × 1 m volume 2.31m3.
</p>
<p>Pallet station load limitations are crucial, by keeping the total
load for each pallet station under 3,000 Kg it is possible to posi-
tion any set of pallets in almost any available pallet position, no
matter which aircraft is being used. In order to maximise the
amount of equipment that can be taken, it is necessary to mini-
mise the weight of the modules themselves, as a result the mod-
ules are constructed of aluminium, which gives a unit weight of
around 200 Kg, whilst the packed weight does not exceed 12,00
Kg.</p>

<p>Figure 1. Four pallet modules take up one aircraft pallet
station. The modules are profiled to fit within the most
commonly used cargo jets.
</p>
<p>The system currently comprises fifty modules split equally
between bottom and top types. They are pre-packed with a variety
of equipment covering containment, recovery, storage and trans-
fer systems for both shoreline and offshore scenarios, as well as
human resources and decontamination. An assessment of the
situation will be made before dispatch with the modules being
“mixed and matched” to produce the required load.
</p>
<p>Loading times are reduced dramatically, the modules are fork-
liftable from all sides and can be quickly loaded onto a pallet tray.
</p>
<p>Modules have been packed to perform one of three functions:-
1. To more efficiently pack ancillary equipment for larger
</p>
<p>systems; for example, support boxes have been created for
containment systems
</p>
<p>2. To package a number of similar items, as per the old box
system
</p>
<p>3. To create working packages. This is the real advantage of
these modules, a conveniently sized and shaped box, de-
signed to fit into the aircraft, containing all the compo-
nents required to carry out a task, which can be efficiently
transported from storage to the spill site
</p>
<p>For example, inshore booms can be packed along with anchors,
chains, buoys, stakes, air-fans, water pumps and other ancillaries.
Packing in this manner allows efficient distribution and deploy-
ment at the destination.
</p>
<p>REDDS offloading system. Total response times can depend
as much on the transport time from the delivery airport to the spill
site, as it does on the flight time. The nearest airport with suitable
cargo offloading facilities may be several hours drive from the
operational area and may even be in another country. Adequate
cargo handling facilities are not as common as often believed,
many airports are based solely around passengers and may only
have a small forklift truck. This factor greatly reduces the options
available to companies planning to fly equipment during a re-
sponse.
</p>
<p>For these situations a self build offloading system can be em-
ployed, to be successful such a system must fulfil certain criteria,
firstly it must be able to travel in the same aircraft as the loaded
</p>
<p>equipment and as such must fit onto the standard aircraft pallet
station. At the destination, the system will need to be manually
removable from the aircraft, then quickly and easily erected to
remove the load. In answer to these requirements the Rapid
Equipment Delivery and Deployment System (REDDS) has been
developed (Figure 2).
</p>
<p>Figure 2. The REDDS, offloading aircraft pallet modules
from a Boeing 707.
</p>
<p>The REDDS is totally self contained and requires no power
from the aircraft for its operation. It is designed to be suitable for
use with any side loading aircraft with a maximum cargo door sill
height of 4 metres from the ground. A combination of jacks and
locating rings are used to make the system readily compatible for
aircraft with a lower sill height. The system is comprised of two
main elements:
</p>
<p>1. An aluminium tower that is erected on a steel box frame
and extends above the cargo door is used to offload the
scissor lift into its position within the base frame and to
act as a support for the winches that winch the equipment
out from aircraft onto the scissor lift.
</p>
<p>2. A scissor lift, powered by a diesel generator, is used to
lower equipment on pallet trays from the aircraft to
ground level.
</p>
<p>The complexity of the system requires experienced and trained
personnel to accompany or meet the system at its destination.
</p>
<p>Conclusion
</p>
<p>There are many factors that can affect the response efficiency
of a International spill response centre and the rapid and effective
transportation of equipment by air is just one. With a purpose
built and ready loaded pallet module system the process may be
made more efficient and give greater flexibility to the response
providers. If such a system is used in conjunction with a self build
offloader then the responders may be able to deliver closer to the
spill site saving time and money.
